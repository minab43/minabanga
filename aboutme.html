            <p class="aboutme"> My name is Mina Banga and I am eighteen years old. My birthday is December 17th, 2004 and I am a freshman in college. I'm a full time student at SUNY New Paltz. I grew up in Orange County California, then August of 2021, I moved to New York. Even though I grew up in California, I’m also Canadian. My ethnicity is a mix of Persian and Indian. Although I’m an undecided major, I’ve been looking into Business and Computer Science. My biggest passions is playing the guitar, singing on the side of it, acting and performing arts, and playing video games. I also enjoy playing sports like tennis and volleyball. I enjoy the outdoors and overall going on adventures with my friends. My side job is being an art teacher for after-school programs in elementary schools. Where I see myself after graduating is hopefully traveling and creating business connections, or working on computers more. </p>
