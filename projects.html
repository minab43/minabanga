   <p class="Projects">Since I was well rounded with the arts, I hold a lot of different passions. One is guitar. I started playing when I was in 4th grade and continued to become more advanced to this day. I also love Acting because playing a different character and embracing the drama theater passion I have. Another passion I have is teaching kids arts and crafts in different elementary schools. That was my favorite job and I always hosted birthday parties for my sister since she loves to do arts and crafts. Aside from the arts, I love video games. I enjoy making compilations not only showing my skill, but how much fun I have with my friends. Also, I was so used to traveling with my mom, when we moved from California to New York, we drove across the country to get here. Finally, I enjoy making playlists with my Spotify account, since I'm a big music person.</p>
